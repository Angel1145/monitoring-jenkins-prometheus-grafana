Case Study

Your manager has called you for a meeting because he has created a ticket in Jira Kanban that he would like you to work on. 
The ticket involves provisioning a robust and scalable Jenkins infrastructure using Terraform Cloud, Bash script, and Docker container, 
as well as creating a monitoring solution with Prometheus container for scraping data and Grafana for visualizing the data.

To complete this task, you will need to perform the following steps:

Define the infrastructure requirements: Before provisioning the Jenkins infrastructure,
you need to define the infrastructure requirements, such as the number of build nodes, the required resources for each node,
and any other dependencies. You must gather this information from the development team and production team.

Provision the Jenkins infrastructure: Once you have defined the infrastructure requirements, you can use Terraform Cloud to provision the infrastructure automatically. 
You must create Terraform configuration files that define the infrastructure components, such as the EC2 instances for the build nodes, 
the security groups, the load balancer, and the other required resources.

Configure the Jenkins server: Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you will need to configure the Jenkins server with the required installations using a Bash script. 
You must create a Bash script that installs Git, Ansible, Docker, Docker-compose, Terraform, Wget, Curl, patch-management, cleaning the cache, 
and removing outdated packages.

Configure the Jenkins pipeline: Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you will need to configure the Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy the application automatically. 
You will need to create a Declarative Jenkins script that defines the pipeline stages, such as building the application, running the tests, 
and deploying the application to the staging area of the production environment.

Implement monitoring solution: To monitor the Jenkins infrastructure and pipeline, you must implement a monitoring solution using Prometheus and Grafana.
Creating a Prometheus container that scrapes the Jenkins metrics and stores them in a time-series database would be best. 
You must also create a Grafana container that visualizes the metrics using dashboards and alerts and configure its data source as Prometheus.

Test and optimize the infrastructure: Once the infrastructure and pipeline are provisioned and configured, you must thoroughly test them to ensure they work as expected.
You will also need to optimize the infrastructure for performance, scalability, and cost by fine-tuning the parameters, 
such as the build timeouts, resource allocation, and testing suites.

In conclusion, provisioning a robust and scalable Jenkins infrastructure using Terraform Cloud, Bash script, and Docker container and creating a monitoring solution with Prometheus container and Grafana for visualizing the data requires a combination of infrastructure, 
scripting, containerization, and monitoring skills. Completing this task will showcase your ability to work with these technologies and deliver a 
reliable and efficient Jenkins pipeline for the development team 
and the organization.
