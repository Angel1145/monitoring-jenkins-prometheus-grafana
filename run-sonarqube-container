# Sonarqube Scanner 

This command runs a Docker container with the name "sonarqube" and exposes the ports 9000 and 9092. 
The container runs the "sonarqube" image, which is a tool for continuous code quality inspection. 
The port 9000 is used for accessing the SonarQube web interface, and the port 9092 is used for communication between SonarQube and other tools in the CI/CD pipeline. 
The "-d" flag specifies that the container should be run in detached mode, meaning it runs in the background.
