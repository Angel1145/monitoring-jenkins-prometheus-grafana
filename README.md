Early detection of issues: By monitoring the Jenkins infrastructure, DevOps engineers can detect any issues or anomalies early on. This can help them resolve the issues before they become more serious and cause major disruptions to the development process.


Performance optimization: With monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, DevOps engineers can analyze the performance of their Jenkins infrastructure and identify areas that need optimization. This can help improve the overall efficiency of the infrastructure and ensure that it can handle increased workloads.


Resource management: Monitoring the Jenkins infrastructure can help DevOps engineers keep track of resource utilization, such as CPU and memory usage. By identifying areas where resources are being over-utilized, they can make adjustments to optimize resource allocation and prevent performance issues.


Capacity planning: DevOps engineers can use monitoring tools to forecast future resource needs based on historical usage patterns. This can help them plan for capacity expansion before resource constraints become an issue.


Overall, monitoring Jenkins infrastructure using Prometheus-Grafana is crucial for ensuring that the development process runs smoothly, and issues are identified and resolved quickly.
